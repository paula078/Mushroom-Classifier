# 🍄 Mushroom Classifier 🍄

This project was a collaborative effort undertaken with friends as part of the 'Artificial Intelligence in Computer Systems' course at AGH University of Technology during the academic year 2023/2024.

The project entailed the development of a neural network leveraging the ResNet101 architecture. Its primary objective was to classify mushroom images into one of nine distinct categories based on their visual characteristics.
